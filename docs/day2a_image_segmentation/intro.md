# Image segmentation & surfaces

This section contains an introdcution into image segmentation, a.k.a. pixel classification as well as creating meshes from segmented data. In particular, this will cover the following topics:

| Topic | Description | Link |
| ----- | ----------- | ---- |
| **Segmentation & Surfaces** | Introduction to image segmentation and surface extraction & processing | [Slides](segmentation_and_surfaces.pf) |
| Thresholding | Basic technique to separate foreground from background | [Slides](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Image-data-science-with-Python-and-Napari-EPFL2022/raw/main/docs/day2d_image_segmentation/Thresholding.pdf) |
| Instance segmentation | Separating different objects in an image | [Slides](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Image-data-science-with-Python-and-Napari-EPFL2022/raw/main/docs/day2d_image_segmentation/Instance_segmentation.pdf)|
| Segmentation quality estimation | How to measure the quality of a segmentation | [Slides](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Image-data-science-with-Python-and-Napari-EPFL2022/raw/main/docs/day2d_image_segmentation/segmentation_quality_estimation.pdf)

The course will follow along the slides on **Segmentation & Surfaces**. The other slides are provided for reference and further explanations, if needed.
