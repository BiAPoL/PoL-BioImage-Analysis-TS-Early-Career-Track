# Plotting Data with Python

This part will teach you how to plot data with matplotlib and seaborn. We start with matplotlib, because seaborn is based upon it and some syntax may be useful with seaborn.

We then look at sophisticated and stylish plots straight from pandas dataframes. You will learn how to plot scatter plots, boxplots, distribution plots and even multivariate plots.
