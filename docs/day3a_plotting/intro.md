# Plotting Data with Python

This part will teach you how to plot data with matplotlib and seaborn. We start with matplotlib, because seaborn is based upon it and some syntax may be useful with seaborn.

We then look at sophisticated and stylish plots straight from pandas dataframes. You will learn how to plot scatter plots, boxplots, distribution plots and even multivariate plots. We also show how to add statistical annotations to your plots as a convenient way to display statistical test results on the figures.

Finally, you will employ all the tools learned during the previous sections to work on a complete image analysis workflow, from reading raw images, through image processing and feature extraction, to displaying your data analysis results in figures.
