# Image segmentation

This section contains an introdcution into image segmentation, a.k.a. pixel classification. In this chapter, you learn about basic terminology and the simplest segmentation technique - thresholding.

In this session we will explore different algorithms for instance segmentation. Classical methods are typically combinations of image filtering methods, threshold algorithms and labeling algorithms such as connected component analysis.

We will also dive into instance segmentation quality metrics and play [The Segmentation Game](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/the-segmentation-game).
