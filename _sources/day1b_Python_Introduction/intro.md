# Introduction to Python part I

This chapter serves getting us all on the same page regarding Python basics, Jupyter notebooks and basic data structures including images.

* Python basics: Command line, Jupyter Notebooks, variables, operators, math, importing libraries ([Slides](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Image-data-science-with-Python-and-Napari-EPFL2022/raw/main/docs/day1b_Python_Introduction/Python_basics.pdf))
* Python data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, cropping, masking and sorting ([Slides](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Image-data-science-with-Python-and-Napari-EPFL2022/raw/main/docs/day1b_Python_Introduction/Python_data_structures.pdf))
