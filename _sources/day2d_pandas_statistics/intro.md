# Working with tabular data and Statistics
In this chapter we will explore working with tabular data using the [pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/). We will explore tabular datasets, extract rows and columns from tables, eliminate NaNs and do basic descriptive statistics on measurements. We will also combine tables and manipulate them to make them easy to be grouped and have functions applied.

Following tables, we will teach you how to apply statistical methods for hypothesis testing to your data, like normality tests, t-tests, analysis of variance, etc.
