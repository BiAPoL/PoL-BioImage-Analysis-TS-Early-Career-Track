# Working with tabular data
In this chapter we will explore working with tabular data using the [pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/). We will explore tabular datasets, extract rows and columns from tables, eliminate NaNs and do basic descriptive statistics on measurements. We will also combine tables and manipulate them to make them easy to be grouped and have functions applied.

Some notebooks here are inspired from [material from Justin Bois](https://justinbois.github.io/dd-pol/2022/index.html).

# Statistics

This part will teach you how to apply statistical methods to your data. We will start with simple descriptive statistics, establish how to calculate confidence intervals by bootstrapping and finish with an overview of statistical methods for hypothesis testing.
